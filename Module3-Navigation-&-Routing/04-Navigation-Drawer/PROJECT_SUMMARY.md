## 🚀 Three Complete Examples

### 1. Classic Drawer (Modal) - `classic_drawer_example.dart`
**Learning Focus:** Basic implementation, programmatic control
- **Features:**
  - `Scaffold.drawer` with `ListTile` items
  - `UserAccountsDrawerHeader` for user info
  - Programmatic drawer opening via `Scaffold.of(context).openDrawer()`
  - Simple navigation with `Navigator.push()`
  - Example pages (Home, Search, Profile, Settings, Help)

### 2. Named Routes + Selected State - `named_routes_example.dart`
**Learning Focus:** Route management, visual feedback
- **Features:**
  - Centralized route definitions in `MaterialApp.routes`
  - Selected state highlighting based on current route
  - Custom Material 3 styled header
  - `onUnknownRoute` handling for 404 pages
  - Enhanced accessibility with proper semantics

### 3. Material 3 NavigationDrawer + Adaptive Rail - `material3_drawer_example.dart`
**Learning Focus:** Modern APIs, responsive design
- **Features:**
  - Material 3 `NavigationDrawer` with `NavigationDrawerDestination`
  - Responsive design with `LayoutBuilder` (breakpoint at 900px)
  - `NavigationRail` for wide screens with persistent navigation
  - Shared navigation destinations between drawer and rail
  - State preservation across layout changes
