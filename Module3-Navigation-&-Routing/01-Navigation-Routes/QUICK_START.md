# Quick Start Guide

## Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (latest stable version)
- Dart 3.6.1 or higher
- An IDE (VS Code, Android Studio, etc.)

### 2. Setup
1. Clone or download this module
2. Open the project in your IDE
3. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
4. Ensure you have a device/emulator running

### 3. Running the Examples

#### Option 1: Run All Examples
```bash
flutter run
```
This will start the main app with a module selector.

#### Option 2: Run Individual Examples
To run a specific example, modify `lib/main.dart`:

```dart
// For basic navigation
import 'basic_navigation/main.dart';

// For named routes
import 'named_routes/main.dart';

// For data passing
import 'data_passing/main.dart';

// For complete example
import 'complete_example/main.dart';
```

### 4. Learning Path

#### Step 1: Basic Navigation
1. Run the basic navigation example
2. Understand `Navigator.push()` and `Navigator.pop()`
3. See how the navigation stack works
4. Try the different navigation buttons

#### Step 2: Named Routes
1. Run the named routes example
2. Understand route definitions in `MaterialApp`
3. See how `onGenerateRoute` works
4. Try navigating with arguments

#### Step 3: Data Passing
1. Run the data passing example
2. Understand constructor parameters vs route arguments
3. See how data is returned via `Navigator.pop()`
4. Try the form examples

#### Step 4: Complete Example
1. Run the complete example app
2. See all concepts working together
3. Understand the Item model and data flow
4. Try adding, editing, and navigating between items

### 5. Key Files to Explore

- `lib/data_passing/home_page.dart` - Sending and receiving data
- `lib/data_passing/details_page.dart` - Form with data return
- `lib/data_passing/profile_page.dart` - Complex data structures

#### Complete Example
- `lib/complete_example/main.dart` - Full app with all concepts
- `lib/complete_example/app_routes.dart` - Advanced route management
- `lib/complete_example/models/item.dart` - Custom data model
- `lib/complete_example/home_page.dart` - List with navigation
- `lib/complete_example/item_details_page.dart` - Item editing
- `lib/complete_example/add_item_page.dart` - Form creation
- `lib/complete_example/settings_page.dart` - Settings management

### 6. Common Commands

```bash
# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run the app
flutter run

# Run on specific device
flutter run -d <device-id>

# Hot reload (while app is running)
r

# Hot restart (while app is running)
R

# Stop the app
q

# Check for issues
flutter analyze

# Format code
flutter format .

# Run tests
flutter test
```

### 7. Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

**"Target of URI doesn't exist"**
- Run `flutter pub get`
- Check import paths

**"No supported devices connected"**
- Start an emulator or connect a device
- Run `flutter devices` to see available devices

**"Hot reload not working"**
- Save all files
- Try hot restart (R) instead
- Check for syntax errors

**"App crashes on navigation"**
- Check for null safety issues
- Verify route definitions
- Check console for error messages

1. **Complete the Exercises**: Work through `EXERCISES.md`
2. **Read the Summary**: Review `SUMMARY.md` for best practices
3. **Experiment**: Modify the examples to try different approaches
4. **Build Your Own**: Create a simple app using these concepts
