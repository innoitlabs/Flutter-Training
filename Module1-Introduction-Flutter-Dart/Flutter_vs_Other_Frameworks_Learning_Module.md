## 1. Overview of Flutter

### What is Flutter?
Flutter is Google's open-source UI software development kit (SDK) for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. It uses the Dart programming language and features a unique widget-based architecture.

### Key Characteristics
- **Language:** Dart (object-oriented, type-safe, null-safe)
- **Architecture:** Widget-based UI system with reactive programming
- **Rendering Engine:** Skia (same as Chrome) for consistent cross-platform rendering
- **Hot Reload:** Instant code changes without losing app state
- **Single Codebase:** Write once, run anywhere (mobile, web, desktop)

### Flutter Architecture

## 2. Framework Comparisons

### 2.1 Flutter vs React Native

#### React Native Overview
React Native uses JavaScript/TypeScript and React concepts to build mobile apps with native components. It bridges JavaScript with native platform APIs.

#### Performance Comparison
| Aspect | Flutter | React Native |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| **Rendering** | Direct to Skia canvas | Native components via bridge |
| **Performance** | Near-native (60fps) | Good, but bridge overhead |
| **Memory Usage** | Lower | Higher due to JS runtime |
| **Startup Time** | Faster | Slower (JS engine startup) |

#### Development Experience
```dart
// Flutter - Widget-based approach
class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      child: Text('Hello Flutter'),
    );
  }
}
```

```javascript
// React Native - Component-based approach
const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Hello React Native</Text>
    </View>
  );
};
```
